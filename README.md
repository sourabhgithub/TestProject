Here's a rephrased version of the text:

Thank you for your response.

Regarding the Service Account, we have the option to generate the service_account.json file. If the Google Cloud team can create this file for us, we will be able to retrieve the access token needed to authenticate Firebase. Additionally, if we are granted the necessary access to the Service Account, we will be able to use it for further tasks as well.

Below is the JSON structure for the Service Account:

{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "<project-id>",
  "private_key_id": "<private-key-id>",
  "private_key": "<private-key>",
  "client_email": "<client-email>",
  "client_id": "<client-id>",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/<firebase-identifier>.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}

Best regards,
