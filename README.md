To set up version control (VCS) and clone a repository in IntelliJ IDEA, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Open IntelliJ IDEA

1. Launch IntelliJ IDEA.

### Step 2: Get from Version Control

1. **Select VCS Option**:
   - On the welcome screen, click on **Get from VCS**.
   - If you already have a project open, go to `File` > `New` > `Project from Version Control`.

### Step 3: Clone the Repository

1. **Enter Repository URL**:
   - In the dialog that appears, enter the URL of the repository you want to clone. This can be an HTTPS or SSH URL.

2. **Select Local Directory**:
   - Choose a local directory where you want to clone the repository by clicking on the `Directory` field.

3. **Authentication (if needed)**:
   - If the repository is private, you may need to enter your username and password or use an SSH key.

4. **Clone**:
   - Click the **Clone** button. IntelliJ will start cloning the repository.

### Step 4: Open the Project

1. **Import Project**:
   - Once cloning is complete, IntelliJ IDEA will usually open the project automatically. If it doesn’t, you may need to open the cloned directory manually by going to `File` > `Open...` and selecting the project directory.

### Step 5: Configure the Project (if necessary)

1. **Set Project SDK**:
   - If prompted, set the project SDK by going to `File` > `Project Structure` (or press `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S`) and selecting the appropriate SDK.

2. **Maven/Gradle Setup (if applicable)**:
   - If your project uses Maven or Gradle, IntelliJ will automatically detect it and set up the dependencies. You can view them in the Maven or Gradle tool window.

### Step 6: Start Working

1. **Build and Run**:
   - You can now build the project using the `Build` menu and run it using the run configurations in the top right corner.

### Additional Tips

- **VCS Integration**: IntelliJ IDEA has excellent support for VCS like Git, Mercurial, etc. You can commit changes, push, pull, and manage branches directly within the IDE.
- **Check VCS Settings**: You can configure VCS settings by going to `File` > `Settings` > `Version Control`.

That’s it! You should now have the repository cloned and set up in IntelliJ IDEA. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask!
