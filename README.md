When incorporating a story or task name (e.g., JIRA ticket ID) in your commit messages, it’s essential to maintain clarity while adhering to a consistent structure. Here’s a guideline for writing commit messages that include a story name or task ID:

1. Format: [StoryID] Subject Line
Always begin the commit message with the story ID (e.g., [PROJ-123]), followed by a clear and concise subject line.
Example: [PROJ-123] Fix issue with user login redirection
2. Use the Imperative Mood
As with standard commit messages, use the imperative mood. This describes what the commit does rather than what it did.
Example: [PROJ-456] Add validation for email input
3. Keep the Subject Line Short (50 characters or less)
The subject line should summarize the change in 50 characters or fewer.
If more explanation is required, use the body of the commit message.
4. Capitalize the First Letter of the Subject
Start the subject with a capital letter for consistency.
Example: [PROJ-789] Improve database query performance
5. Avoid Period at the End of the Subject
Do not add punctuation (e.g., a period) at the end of the subject line.
Example: [PROJ-101] Update homepage layout
6. Optional Body for More Detail (Separate by a Blank Line)
If needed, add a more detailed explanation in the body of the commit message.
Ensure each line in the body doesn’t exceed 72 characters.
Example:
csharp

[PROJ-321] Refactor authentication flow for new users

Refactored the user authentication process to improve security and 
reduce the number of redundant database queries. This change also 
addresses edge cases where session tokens were not properly invalidated.

Fixes #567
7. Reference Related Issues, Bugs, or Tickets in the Body
If applicable, use keywords like Fixes, Closes, or Related to with the ticket number to auto-close or associate the issue.
Example: Fixes #678 or Closes PROJ-678
8. Be Consistent
Keep the format consistent across all commits, so it's easier to trace changes and match commits to corresponding tasks or tickets.
Example Structure
Short Commit Message:

[PROJ-123] Fix login issue for returning users
Detailed Commit Message:

[PROJ-456] Refactor user authentication flow to improve performance

The authentication logic has been updated to reduce redundant database 
queries. This change improves login performance by 20%, ensuring that 
the user login experience is smoother. 

Fixes PROJ-456
Best Practices:
Use the ticket ID at the beginning: This helps team members easily find the relevant JIRA or tracking system ticket.
Explain the why and how in the body: When necessary, use the body to provide additional context about why the change was made.
Link to the story or issue: If your project management system automatically links issues and commits, this helps with traceability.
By following this approach, your commit messages will be clear, concise, and traceable to specific stories or tasks in your tracking system.
